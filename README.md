# Quora Question Pair Analysis using LSTMs

## Overview

Welcome to the Quora Question Pair Analysis project! This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to analyze pairs of questions from Quora and determine whether they are semantically similar. By addressing this problem, we aim to improve question deduplication, enhance user experience, and optimize content management on the Quora platform.

## Introduction

Duplicate questions on Quora can lead to redundancy and inefficiency in knowledge sharing. To combat this, we use LSTM networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction tasks, to identify question pairs that are similar. This project not only showcases the power of LSTMs in natural language processing (NLP) but also provides a robust solution for real-world applications.

## Dataset

We use the Quora Question Pairs dataset, which contains over 400,000 question pairs with binary labels indicating whether the questions are duplicates.

### Features

- **id**: Unique identifier for the question pair
- **qid1, qid2**: Unique identifiers for each question
- **question1, question2**: The actual questions
- **is_duplicate**: Label (1 if questions are duplicates, 0 otherwise)

## Model Architecture

Our LSTM model consists of the following layers:

- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors of fixed size.
- **Bidirectional LSTM Layer**: Captures dependencies in both forward and backward directions.
- **Dense Layers**: Adds a fully connected neural network to process the LSTM outputs.
- **Output Layer**: A single neuron with sigmoid activation for binary classification.

## Notebooks

### EDA.ipynb

This notebook is dedicated to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It helps in understanding the dataset through visualizations and basic statistical analysis. Key steps include:
- Loading and inspecting the data
- Visualizing the distribution of duplicate and non-duplicate questions
- Basic text preprocessing and tokenization

### Model_Training.ipynb

This notebook covers the training process of the LSTM model. Steps involved are:
- Data preprocessing: tokenization and padding of sequences
- Building the LSTM model with Keras
- Training the model on the Quora Question Pairs dataset
- Saving the trained model for future use

### Evaluation.ipynb

This notebook evaluates the performance of the trained LSTM model. It includes:
- Loading the saved model
- Preprocessing the test data
- Making predictions on the test set
- Calculating performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Training the Model

To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python src/train.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 64 --embedding_dim 100 --lstm_units 128
```

This script will preprocess the data, build the model, and train it on the Quora Question Pairs dataset.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model's performance using the provided evaluation script:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model_path models/lstm_model.h5 --data_path data/test.csv
```

The evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

Our LSTM model achieves impressive performance on the Quora Question Pairs dataset, with high accuracy and robustness in detecting duplicate questions. Detailed results can be found in the `Evaluation.ipynb` notebook.

## Future Work

Future improvements could include:

- Experimenting with different neural network architectures (e.g., GRUs, Transformers).
- Utilizing pre-trained embeddings (e.g., GloVe, BERT) for better contextual understanding.
- Enhancing the model with additional features (e.g., question length, common words).
